## Illustrative Practices
1. Employ ethical behavior to respect the rights of individuals and communities who provide the data.
2. Consider how to solicit feedback from external sources (e.g., getting input from special interest groups or academics before publishing publicly, and/or consider feedback from the public once published â€“ e.g., establishing an inbox or way for public comment on active visualizations, that is actively monitored).
3. Consider how the use of data related to sensitive topics can affect people and communities.
4. Solicit feedback from a range of internal staff regarding your interpretation, analysis, and/or visualization of the data. 
5. Account for how products may be misused to reinforce inequities.
