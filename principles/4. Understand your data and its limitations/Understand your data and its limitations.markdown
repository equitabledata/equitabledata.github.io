# Illustrative Practices
- Think about what data you do NOT have.
- Be transparent about the limits of the data (accuracy, bias/gaps, uncertainty, mechanism)
- Understand the provenance of your data (e.g., survey (and what question(s) were asked), form, sensor data, web scraping, big data, etc.), and how that might affect the quality of the data, and how that might impact different groups (accuracy and interpretation).  
- Evaluate the universe or sample size and its representativeness (i.e. demographic, geographic, and other unique characteristics) related to the inferences you plan to make.
