A Vision for Equitable Data identified the need to build capacity in agencies to design and conduct robust equity assessments: “Agencies need to build the statistical, data science, and evaluation capacity necessary for generating evidence-based policy consistent with the Evidence Act. Such expertise is vital for programs to conduct equity assessments but is currently limited within the federal government.” 

Many agencies have launched Data Science Training Programs to strengthen data skills among the federal data workforce, while expanding and diversifying that workforce.

This guide serves those leading and participating in such Data Science Training programs to clarify and illustrate the practices and skills necessary to implement equitable data principles and conduct equity audits. We focus here on the role of data scientists and data practitioners.
